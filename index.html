    <!-- fetch function return a promise which is the idea when we promise to do something when mission is done 
    this is Asychronious which means you can do other things till the main mission is done. 
    
    Pay attention when using the fetch function we need to catch all errors when it fails. We use 
    the .catch block to catch any errors as following 

    -->
    <script>
        fetch("https://ci-swapi.herokuapp.com/api/")
        .then(response=>response.json())
        .then(data=>displayData(data))
        .catch((e)=>{
            console.error("Error is: ",e)
        })
        function displayData(data){
            document.getElementById('content').innerText=data['people']
        }
    </script>

    <!-- another important concept is the call-back function which is nothing but a function with no name after the  arrow
    in the previous example we have 3 call back function -> theoretically it performs something when the promise is done.
